# AI Landing Zones

The AI Landing Zone provides an enterprise-scale production ready reference architecture with implementation (Portal, Bicep & Terraform) to deploy secure and resilient AI Apps & Agents solutions in Azure.

- The AI Landing Zone is an [application landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-landing-zones-vs-application-landing-zones) meant to act as a foundation for various use cases, scenarios and patterns of AI Apps & Agents based solutions which can be deployed with or without [platform landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-landing-zones-vs-application-landing-zones).
- The IaC implementations of the AI Landing Zone i.e. Bicep and Terraform are based on [Azure Verified Modules](https://aka.ms/AVM).
- The AI Landing Zone focuses on [AI on Azure Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/architectures). A future version of it will cover [AI on Azure Infrastructure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/infrastructure/cycle-cloud).
- The AI Landing Zone has been designed and tested for Azure Public Cloud but can be leveraged in the Azure Government and Sovereign Cloud.
- The AI Landing Zone is able to cover both generative and non-generative scenario per [resource selection guidance CAF AI Scenario](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/resource-selection).
- The AI Landing Zone leverages [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) as the orchestration framework.
- Given the pace of innovation and change in AI, the AI Landing Zone may leverage services in Preview to provide an architecture with latest features.

## Reference Architectures

## Design Checklist

The AI Landing Zone cover the following design areas which are across the Cloud Adoption Framework and the Well-Architected Framework. In each design area there are design considertion and design recommendations to help you design a greenfield environment and assess a brown field environment using the [AI Landing Zone Checklist](/docs/AI-Landing-Zones-Design-Checklist.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions
The frequently asked questions about the AI Landing Zone are documented [here](./docs/AI-Landing-Zones-FAQS.md).

## Cloud Adoption Framework

The AI landing Zone aligns with the guidance in the [CAF AI Scenario](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/). For a holistic implementation of the AI Landing Zone, we recommend to review the [AI Checklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/#ai-checklists). To understand how to leverage the AI Landing Zone as part of a wider strategy, review the guidance on [AI Strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy). AI Landing Zone is part of the AI Ready stage in particular the [AI on Azure platforms (PaaS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/architectures).
